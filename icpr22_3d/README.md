# Academic Project Page Template
This is an academic paper project page template, modified for my habits.

- Example project page **template**: https://lin-tianyu.github.io/project-page-template/

- Example project page of my MICCAI 2024 work: https://lin-tianyu.github.io/Stable-Diffusion-Seg/



## Start using the template
### For webpage ONLY
1. Click on `Use this Template` button to create a new repo;
2. Store all your images/videos in the corresponding folder in `static/*`;
3. Edit the `index.html` file to control the content of the website.

### For repo with a webpage
<details>
<summary>1. Mearge/add this repo to an existing repo;</summary>

```
The easiest way to do so:
   1. download this template as a `*.zip` file and decompress it;
   2. upload the `static` folder and `index.html` file into the existing repo.
```

</details>

2. Working on the repo and writing the paper;
3. To prepare for a **double-blinded review process**:
   - Build the webpage by editing `index.html` (already anonymized);
   - Anonymize the entire repo via [Anonymous Github](https://anonymous.4open.science/);
   - Share the anonymized repo link in the Abstract section.
5. Update authors/institutions/code/pdfs after acceptance.

## NOTES
1. Make sure to replace the `favicon.ico` under `static/images/` with one of your own, otherwise your favicon is going to be mine. You can generate your own `favicon.ico` at [favicon-generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/).
2. By default, authors/institutions/code/pdfs are **anonymous**, you can specify them after your paper's acceptance.
3. The webpage will be deployed automatically by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
